## Post Text

People really seem to love these lists so here I go. The super extended, directors cut edition of **everything** I installed on my mac. Maybe someone has other ideas on how to get rid of a few, or better alternatives? Especially the Notes is still a hot topic, since I hate subscriptions with a passion, but have not found anything similar that meets my requirements.

# [UPDATE VERSION ALWAYS AVAILABLE AT GITHUB](https://github.com/WrkX/MacAppsDirectorsCut)

# General

* [AltTab](https://github.com/lwouis/alt-tab-macos) (**Free, open source**): I guess almost everyone uses this? Almost perfect window switcher. If [Contexts](https://contexts.co/) would still get updates I would use it, but the “Titles” Appearance option is great here, too. Only thing bothering me is that titles scale to the monitor width with no way to change it? Maybe I will fork it and fix it for myself.
* [Applite](https://aerolite.dev/applite) (**Free, open source**): Homebrew Gui. Will maybe switch to [Cork](https://corkmac.app/) (*paid*, **open source)**, I just tested it once, but went back to Applite. Works great so far for me.
* [Alcove](https://tryalcove.com/) (*Paid*): I tried multiple Notch-Apps, and with multiple I mean almost all of them. Alcove is perfect. Looks like a native macos app, updates always add nice additions without bloating it, and my biggest problem (Alcove getting stuck behind the menu bar) was fixed in the last version. Just love it.
* [Shareful](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/shareful/id1522267256?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free**): Simply adds a few very nice options to the share menu. I don’t need it often, but when I do it comes in handy.
* [Mos](https://mos.caldis.me/) (**Free, open source**): Smooth Mouse Scrolling, works great, and I can create exceptions for apps, which is why I use Mos. Some apps, like Citrix Workspace or Moonlight simply bug out with it and randomly scroll up again.
* Keka ([**Free**](https://github.com/aonez/Keka) or [*Paid*](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/keka/id470158793?l=en-GB&mt=12), **open source**): Best unarchiving tool there is.
* [Supercharge](https://sindresorhus.com/supercharge) (*Paid*): Contains a lot of useful tweaks. It gets better with each update it gets. My favorites are “Prevent accidental quits of apps” by requiring me to hold q for a time defined by me instead of just pressing command q and the autoinstall of .dmgs.
* [Swift Shift](https://www.swiftshift.app/) (**Free**, **open source**): Lets you move and resize windows by holding a modifier key. I missed this so much when switching from Linux Hyprland to Macos. There was a bug which skyrocketed the CPU Usage when a specific option was turned on, but that was fixed. This is the only app that does this which also **smoothly** resizes windows. Alternatively you can use [Easy Move+Resize](https://github.com/dmarcotte/easy-move-resize), but imo Swift Shift is better.
* [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org/) (**Free, open source**): Great terminal, switched to it on linux, now I use it here.
* [Enhancements For YouTube](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/enhancements-for-youtube/id1643308157?l=en-GB) (**Free**): Safari Extension that skips sponsor blocks on youtube. I only use Safari on the go, but we will come to that. This safes me time, at home I dont skip for my fav. creators.
* [GoodLinks](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/goodlinks/id1474335294?l=en-GB) (*Paid*):  When I bought this I was not sure I would use this often. I used [raindrop.io](http://raindrop.io), which is completely free, but a website. **EDIT: Apparantly there is a** [**mac app**](https://raindrop.io/download)**!** While there is not much difference I love how easy it integrates into everything. If you dont wanna spend money on saving links for later, use raindrop, get a browser extension and enjoy it. But I love GoodLinks so far! I would love if links marked as “Read” would slide out of the unread section automatically on the mac app like they do in the ios app instead of me having to reload the section, but thats just a small gripe of mine.
* [Mela](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/mela-recipe-manager/id1568924476?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Freemium**): Saves your recipes. Great UI, very smooth, definitely worth the money if you like to cook and have tons of recipes somewhere. Bought it years ago, you buy per platform, so you would have to get it seperately for your phone, but the mac version is enough for me.

# Security & Privacy

* [1Password](https://1password.com/pricing?currency=eur) (*Subscription*) & [1Password for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/1password-for-safari/id1569813296?l=en-GB&mt=12): IMO the best password manager there is. I know a lot of people want an open source one, but either a. their apps suck ([Protonpass](https://proton.me/de/pass), **Free, open source**) or b. they are unreliable ([Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), **Free, open source**).  I tried all password managers,  but 1Password had probably the best password manager app there is, seems to be super secure and has been around since forever. I never trust a company but here I will (even though they shut down the self hosted vaults).  Other paid options dont even come close. Except for:
* Strongbox ([*Subscription*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RojV4NA60RY) *or* [*Lifetime*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc)): RIP. This was the one, but he joined the dark side. They decided to sell it to a trash company that cannot be trusted. We will see what happens here. I dont like KeePassXC, and this one here worked great. **Seemingly the only other option with a quick search for your passwords I found!** I dont know why all other apps are electron trash that is basically just the homepage. The quick search is essential for me, I don’t know how people live without it.
* [Adguard](https://adguard.com/de/adguard-mac/overview.html) (*Paid*): No explaination needed I hope. Lifetime sub for 12$ on stacksocical. Works great for all browsers, no need for extensions, and f\*ck google.
* [LuLu](https://objective-see.org/products/lulu.html) (**Free, open source**): Blocks outgoing connections of apps.I simply block everything going out  and if stuff doesnt work I turn it on.

# Gaming

* [Moonlight](https://moonlight-stream.org/) (**Free, open source**): I have a beefy (Windows) gaming pc, so I use Moonlight so connect to my Apollo host. At home I have direct ethernet connection so I can stream it without any delay or bitrate problems. When I am on the go I use:
* [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1016/install-mac) (**Free**): So I can be on the same network without having to expose much. Simply log in on both devices and you are ready to go. Alternatively use ZeroTier One.
* [Whisky](https://getwhisky.app/) (**Free, open source**): Sometimes I want to run a few simple Windows programs and this is faster than connecting to the other pc. Its just a wine GUI, but it works and is simple.

# Productivity & Utilities

* [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) (*Paid*): I mean, everyone knows Alfred, I guess there is not much to explain. A Spotlight alternative. I am currently debating going back to [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) (**Free** and *Subscription*), but I hate its look. My Alfred bascially looks like Spotlight Search. Its super fast and the Workflows are easy to create. If you need to create an extension for Raycast its a little more involved. Dunno, love both. I also tried [Launchbar](https://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html) (**Freemium**), but it felt weird to use.
* [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) (**Free**): Godsent, with the smart delete mode it will react to you deleting an app and will ask you to remove the leftover stuff. It will of course not find everything, but for me, who loves to try out new stuff, this is great!
* [Calendr](https://github.com/pakerwreah/Calendr) (**Free, open source**): Like [Dato](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/dato/id1470584107?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*Paid*), just free and open source. I love Calendr, because it also creates an extra menu bar item for the next reminder/event, so you can see that e.g. something is due in 35 minutes with the name of said thing. Super handy.
* [Clop](https://lowtechguys.com/clop/) (**Freemium, open source**): To be honest, I only let it monitor my Downloads folder to automatically shrink pictures. I wouldnt miss it if it was gone. I would love to let it automatically do that for my clipboard, but that breaks screenshots I take at work in Citrix Workspace, so I can currently not use this feature. Still great app, maybe I will create a bug for this on github and see if they can somehow create an exclusion list or something.
* [Dropover](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/dropover-easier-drag-drop/id1355679052?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Freemium**): A handy drag and drop file helper. Similar to [Yoink](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/yoink-better-drag-and-drop/id457622435?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*paid*) or [Dropzone 4](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/dropzone-4-enhance-workflow/id1485052491?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*subscription* or *lifetime)*, but better (imo), cheaper and more premium looking. Super customizable and the free version is still great (you have to wait 3 seconds to access the shelf). Highly recommended for only 7,99€! Alternatively there is also [ShakePin](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/shakepin/id6599856142?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free, open source**) which would be what I would use if Dropover ever switches to a subscription model. Or if you dont want to spend money of course.
* [Latest](https://max.codes/latest/) (**Free, open source**): Update utility for your apps. Not as good as [MacUpdater](https://www.corecode.io/macupdater/) (*paid*), which I also use, but it is sadly going to die next year, so I better get used to Latest.
* Maccy ([**Free**](https://github.com/p0deje/Maccy) or [*Paid* (App Store)](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/maccy/id1527619437?l=en-GB&mt=12) or [*Paid* (Gumroad)](https://p0deje.gumroad.com/l/Apsra), **open source**): Clipboard Manager, works great for me, dont need anything else. So I stuck with this.
* [Monocle](https://iamdk.gumroad.com/l/monocle-elegant-macos-window-blur-focus) (*Paid*): Saw the dev advertising it here, tried it and its great. I am currently not using it since the blur is too strong for me and I hope he adds an option to tune it down a little. Alternatively there is [HazeOver](https://hazeover.com/) (*Paid*) or [Blurred](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/blurred/id1497527363?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free**) or [HokusFokus](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/hokusfokus/id1659087771?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free**). All of them seem to do the same thing, but instead of blurring they dim the background. I used them, but I like the blur more than the dimming. But I keep Blurred installed if that changes.
* [PopClip](https://www.popclip.app/) (*Paid*): Great tool to use actions on text you marked. There are a lot of extensions you can simply [download](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/).  I use it so much and miss it the second I use a pc without it. Even if it is just for a quick translation or to google what I marked. Love it.
* [Shottr](https://shottr.cc/) (**Freemium**): Screenshot tool. I got this and never tried another one. You can pay if you want to support development, but the free version has no limits. It just does everything I want from a screenshot app. **EDIT: you cannot create Captures and a Gradient background without paying.**
* [VoiceInk](https://github.com/Beingpax/VoiceInk) (*Paid*, **open source**) The best transcription app I have found. The dev is super active, helpful and updates come in regularly. And its a one time purchase of only 19$. I bought it once for me and once for my wife and it just saves sooooo much time. I also tried [MacWhisper](https://goodsnooze.gumroad.com/l/macwhisper) (**Freemium**) but I prefer VoiceInk. Only thing I miss is the live transcription.

# Browsers & Web Development

* [Arc](https://arc.net/) (**Free**): The dead one. No more development. Still the browser I use the most. If they would have at least added the mac passkey support. Everything else I want from it works. [SigmaOs](https://sigmaos.com/) (**Freemium**) is the “alternative” but I am not sure if its still updated, never ever have I seen such an intransparent product.
* [Orion](https://kagi.com/orion/) (**Free**): Webkit Browser with vertical Tabs. Gets updates regularly, I like it and use it whenevery I am on the go. And if I don’t accidentally use Safari anyway.
* [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/) (**Free, open source**): Would be the best browser if it wouldnt be a Firefox fork. I hate Firefox with a passion. Will maybe switch to it once the features that are in also stay and dont get moved into the about:config settings or get removed completely.

# Note-Taking & Writing

* [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1091189122?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free** or *Subscription*): Great notes app. It looks super sleek, this is what apple notes should be. If you dont need your notes synced to another device this app is a great free one. This is the only subscription I use, only because I have not found anything that looks as perfect designwise while being as great as an editor. I tried
   * FSNotes ([**Free**](https://github.com/glushchenko/fsnotes) or [*Paid*](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/fsnotes/id1277179284?l=en-GB&mt=12), open source), which seems fine,
   * [UpNote](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/upnote-notes-diary-journal/id1398373917?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Freemium**), which I simply do not recommend because they store your notes without an option to not do that. I don't feel save giving all my information to some guys in Vietnam, without any encryption going on.
   * [iA Writer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ia-writer/id775737590?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*Paid*): Great for writing, but feels a little overkill for notes. Didnt wanna spend 120€ for both apps.
   * [Typora](https://typora.io/) (*Paid*): Great alternative writing app, way cheaper. No IOS app.
   * [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md/) (**Free**): I guess everyone knows it? I dont like Electron Apps, so I don’t use this, otherwise this would be it.
   * [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) (**Free**): No customization, also forced Cloud Sync.
   * [Spaces.](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/spaces/id1509611686?l=en-GB) (**Freemium**): If this would be open source it would be great. But its buggy, doesnt get any updates anymore and way to expensive for what it is. Also basically no customization.
   * [Notesnook](https://notesnook.com/) (**Freemium, open source**): Electron App. Similar to Notion, has a webapp, is open source AND E2EE?! Wow, if this thing would have a non-Electron Desktop app…
   * [Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) (**Free, open source**): Feels kinda weird to use, but I will still try it. Not deleted yet.
* [Panda](https://community.bear.app/t/panda-update-new-beta-available-now/12054) (**Free**): It is, as far as I know, the markdown editor of Bear. I use it all the time when I want to edit some textfiles. Its of course not really supported since it was released to test the editor, so its just an old beta product.
* [Day One](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/day-one/id1055511498?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free** or *Subscription*): A journal App. Since Apple hasnt released their app for MacOS yet, I use Day One and [Everlog](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/everlog-journal/id1519935634?l=en-GB) (**Freemium**). I prefer Day One, but Everlog has a One Time Purchase option. I am still testing both and I am still not sure which one I will use in the future. Both are great.
* [ProNotes](https://www.pronotes.app/) (**Freemium**): Basically allows Markdown in the Apple Notes app, has the option to add AI features etc. If you do not need AI features its free. Great app, but I use Bear Notes. I just keep in if I switch back to Apple Notes.

# Development & Coding

* [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/xcode/id497799835?l=en-GB&mt=12) (**Free**): Editor for Swift. No alternative. On my mac I only develop Swift so I don't have other IDEs.
* [GitHub Copilot for Xcode](https://github.com/github/CopilotForXcode) (**Free** or *Subscription*, **open source**): It’s fine, sometimes helpful, sometimes produces trash. I mean, its AI.

# Media & Entertainment

* [Cronica](https://github.com/egger/cronica) (**Free, open source**): A Watchlist for movies and shows.
* [Dropclock](https://github.com/WrkX/Dropclock) (**Free, open source**, self promotion): My own App, a [Gestimer](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/gestimer-2/id6447125648?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*Paid*) alternative to create timers/reminders from the menubar. Simply drag and drop from the menu bar item to create a new timer/reminder.
* [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/) (**Free, open source**): A music tagger. I don’t use a music streaming service and this lets me easily tag, rename etc. my Music automatically. Life saver.
* [Sleeve](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/sleeve-for-spotify-music/id1606145041?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*Paid*): A little music player widget I have on my desktop. 99% of the time it is useless for me, since I…. well… have stuff open. But whatever I guess. Looks great, very customizable. If you look at your desktop more often, maybe it is for you.

# System & Menubar

* [Barbee](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/barbee-hide-menu-bar-items/id1548711022?l=en-GB&mt=12) (*Paid*): My current menu bar app. Puts all menu bar items in an extra bar to not have it as crowded. I have used [iBar](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/ibar-pro-menubar-control-tool/id6737150304?l=en-GB&mt=12)(*Paid*) before, but refunded it because it had some really weird glitches and was 9,99€. Barbee is the best menu bar item manager I have found so far and costs only 3,99€. Alternatively there is of course [Ice](https://github.com/jordanbaird/Ice) (**Free, open source**) and I am still working on my fork that fixes **my** problems with it (new items getting moved in the extra bar by default instead of appearing in the menu bar by default, the weird right click menu on the menu bar, few other things), but right now I love Barbee and it works perfectly with basically zero resource impact on the pc at all. Ice uses more resources (still, not much). There is also [Bartender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM3uXu1Dq4c) (*Paid*) which was bought by the same [trash company](https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOS/comments/1dagrbp/the_last_app_bartenders_new_owners_applause_group/) that bough Strongbox.
* [Lunar](https://lunar.fyi/) (**Freemium, open source**): App to change display stuff. I love it for the sub zero dimming so I can use it better while in bed. I have used [Better Display](https://github.com/waydabber/BetterDisplay) (**Freemium, open source**) before, but somehow when enableing HiDpi mode here my display randomly turned off and I had to disconnect it to get it working again. I guess thats a monitor problem, can recommend both.
* [SaneSideButtons](https://github.com/thealpa/SaneSideButtons) (**Free, Open Source**): Forked version of abandoned SensibleSideButtons. Used to make the side buttons of the mouse work.
* [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) (**Free, open source**): Great tool. Lets you customize how keyboards work, independently of each other. My Mac keyboard is set up diffently than my mechanical one. I also used it to replicate Hyperkey, without the need of an additional Application. A lot of useful stuff in here, all for free!

# File Management & Storage

* Koofr ([*Subscription*](https://koofr.eu/) or [*Lifetime*](https://www.stacksocial.com/sales/koofr-cloud-storage-plans-lifetime-subscription-1tb)): IMO great cloud storage, but I have read that if you are not european the speed can be kinda slow? I love that I can share my storage with my wife and she can access that from the app directly.
* [Mountain Duck](https://mountainduck.io/help/) (*Paid*): To mount my other storage directly into Finder. I also tried [Cloudmounter](https://cloudmounter.net/) (*Paid*) which i liked better and is cheaper, but I already paid for Mountain Duck… but hey, I supported a partial open source project so I am totally fine with this.
* [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) (**free, open source**): Same creators as Mountain Duck, does bascially the same, just without mouting it to finder. I use it for quick sftp stuff, that I dont constantly need.
* [calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) (**free, open source**): Ebook management. Nothing to explain.

There you go, hope you enjoyed it!

> Taking issue with your beef with UpNote.
> 
> Firstly, you *don't* have to store your data on the vendor's servers. The app can be used 100% locally. You can't *sync* between devices if your data isn't stored on the vendor's servers, but that's also true of the *vast* majority of note-taking apps.
> 
> If you need E2EE for note-taking, UpNote isn't for you — but again, that's true of *dozens* of note-taking apps that you haven't singled out here. But if you don't keep anything sensitive in your notes, it's not a big worry. It would be great if E2EE was an option in UpNote, and that may be a dealbreaker for *you*, but for other (like me) it might be more important to be able to publish links to your pages for others to access.
> 
> As for storing data on the vendor's servers, that's exactly why I *don't* use one of the apps you've praised highly — 1Password. Forget notes, *passwords* are definitely something I don't want on somebody else's storage where I have no control. Yes, user vaults are encrypted. That doesn't mean they're safe. Just ask LastPass users. Keeping millions of password vaults on a single vendor's server makes for a juicy target. That's a big HELL NO for me.
> 
> But back to note-taking: Bear is not a replacement for Apple Notes if you need anything beyond the most basic formatting. No text colors, no text alignment options, etc. Bear is beautifully designed, and does have the best #nesting/tags# in the business, and I love it for that. But if you need flexible formatting options (and I do), [Upnote literally can't be beat](https://getupnote.com/share/notes/y4NYv23IvoNYGb1UAPy1OjwRXoy1/fdb7668f-d5ce-4956-bbe4-4be881dc1c0a).

>> I see where you are coming from.   
>> I bought Upnote and used it for a few weeks, but having the sync only through them is what bothers me. Most of the other ones I mentioned let you sync through w/e you choose. 
>> 
>> No E2EE is no dealbreaker, but for my notes it would be great. Dont get me wrong, Bear also doesnt E2EE them, but the notes are with apple who I trust more than other companies when it comes to this (which is also stupid).
>> 
>> And yeah, I dont share my notes. 
>> 
>> But again, Bear is far from perfect, its just what works for me right now. My notes are also barebones af, like, tables and headers, some inline pics, thats it. :)

>>   
>> Maybe I will go back to Upnote, maybe I will find something else. Tbh. I have switched my note app in the last 2 months a lot of times....

>> On 1Password I disagree actually.
>> 
>> I trust a company that is only doing this and has been for nearly 20 years more than ... well others or even myself. Even if their attack surface is larger and attackers have a reason to try to breach them, I am not a security expert. Keeping this stuff save is their whole business and if I would selfhost my passwords I would try to compete with a team that knows this shit. They also have their audits regularly which most Password managers dont seem to do. 
>> 
>> I have a  backup that is xchacha encrypted in my Proton Drive, but thats as far as I go now. If Strongbox would still be an option I would of course "selfhost" my passwords, like I did before, but I feel kinda safer this way, dunno.

>>> My priority with note-taking is formatting flexibility, so I'm an UpNote stan all the way. :) It's also far from perfect — all that formatting flexibility inevitably leads to some HTML hiccups, and they could really do with a dedicated QA person — but it's literally the only app that does All The Things for me. And they're really quick with the bug fixes.
>>> 
>>> I'd love the ability to sync via my own cloud accounts (which is what my chosen password manager does), but having said that, syncing is one of the things UpNote does best. It's so fast, that I can be two-screening and see changes happen within seconds on my second screen.

>> GoodLinks also uses probably the fairest "Subscription" Model i have seen (a few apps use this). When buying you get all new features for 2 years. After that resubbing for a month will grant the same again (afaik). So you just have to pay for new features every 2 years (if you feel like you are missing any features). I cannot imagine what I would be missing from a bookmark manager/read later app right now that he could add feature wise.

> Clop fucked up the way my system handles video files. With clop installed everytime I double click a video file to watch a movie clop intercepts and compresses file. and I paused optimization and it still did the same shit. after uninstalling clop and restarting my system when I open a video file QuickTime opens it but it doesn’t auto play instead I have to press the play button. I emailed the dev and explained my problem hopefully he gets back to me; in the meantime time I’m gonna wipe, reset, and reinstall sequoia. I’ll be testing apps in VM from now on before I install it on my main system.

>> Hey, is there any chance when you had Clop installed you set video files to open in Clop by default? Because that is the only explanation I can think of. I'm using Clop myself and files only optimize when dropped to Clop's overlay or put in my Desktop (which Clop watches).

>> Gecko is imo worse than webkit. its slow and firefox is burning money instead of adding years old technology. Dont know whats gonna happen to em should the funding from google stop.
>> 
>> Dont get me wrong, I want firefox to be more successful, but they dont seem to do anything. Monopolys suck, but there is a reason google started chrome.  I am by no means a web dev and i dunno whats supported on chrome, safari, firefox etc., all I know is that firefox is the slowest browser I have tested, by a laaaarge margin. So until they get their sht together its a huge nope from me.

Even if their attack surface is larger and attackers have a reason to try to breach them, I am not a security expert.

>> My priority with note-taking is formatting flexibility, so I'm an UpNote stan all the way. :) It's also far from perfect — all that formatting flexibility inevitably leads to some HTML hiccups, and they could really do with a dedicated QA person — but it's literally the only app that does All The Things for me. And they're really quick with the bug fixes.
>> 
>> I'd love the ability to sync via my own cloud accounts (which is what my chosen password manager does), but having said that, syncing is one of the things UpNote does best. It's so fast, that I can be two-screening and see changes happen within seconds on my second screen.

After that resubbing for a month will grant the same again (afaik). So you just have to pay for new features every 2 years (if you feel like you are missing any features). I cannot imagine what I would be missing from a bookmark manager/read later app right now that he could add feature wise.

>> A:
>> MacUpdater 3 has received many feature updates throughout 2023 and 2024 and will continue to be supported throughout 2025 for all existing customers. MacUpdater 3 will be discontinued on 01-01-2026.
>> After 01-01-2026 we will publish one final version of MacUpdater 3 that you will be able to use indefinitely. However, that version will not be able to connect to our server-backend or take advantage of our daily maintenance, so it will be of limited use.
>> At the moment we do not have any information about whether MacUpdater (e.g. in version 4.x) will still be available in 2026 and beyond. We'll share more info when it becomes available.

> I just have not even thought about switching from spotlight so far for example, even though it bothers me often (e.g. if I type "display" it won't give me the display settings, only when typing "displays"). Thank you for these recomendations, will check them out :)

>> Ye, Spotlight is bad. Super slow and doesnt show what you want. Give Raycast a try, it will def show that and you can even decide which system settings should be shown in the bar and which ones are ignored

> Ah, okay. Thanks for the update (ha)!
> It sounds like that’s just for the older version, MacUpdater 3. Considering the survey they put out a few days ago (maybe week now), they’re probably gauging how to price it going forward.

> Q: How long will MacUpdater 3 remain supported?
> A:
> MacUpdater 3 has received many feature updates throughout 2023 and 2024 and will continue to be supported throughout 2025 for all existing customers. MacUpdater 3 will be discontinued on 01-01-2026.
> After 01-01-2026 we will publish one final version of MacUpdater 3 that you will be able to use indefinitely. However, that version will not be able to connect to our server-backend or take advantage of our daily maintenance, so it will be of limited use.
> At the moment we do not have any information about whether MacUpdater (e.g. in version 4.x) will still be available in 2026 and beyond. We'll share more info when it becomes available.
