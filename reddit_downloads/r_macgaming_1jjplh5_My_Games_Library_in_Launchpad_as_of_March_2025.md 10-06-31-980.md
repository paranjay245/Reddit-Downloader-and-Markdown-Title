## Post Text

I started gaming on the Mac in 2009 - the indie hayday. Titles like *Fez*, *Undertale*, and *Kentucky Route Zero* turned my world upside down and made me a true believer in the power of games. Many years later now, and it's beautiful to see the Mac finally coming into its own as a place to game. I added *Red Dead Redemption 2* through Crossplay over the weekend and decided it was time to document the "state of gaming" on my Mac.

  
**LAUNCHERS**  
You'll see the standards like Steam, itch.io, and Epic Games Store (tucked on the last page), but also a few others that expand what's available to play like Xbox Cloud Gaming and NVIDIA GeForce Now for cloud gaming, Crossover and Whiskey for virtual PC, and RetroArch, DOSBox, and PCSX2 for emulation. I've also got Mirror, an app to mirror your PlayDate handheld screen to your Mac.



**ICONS**  
I'm a stickler for standard macOS icons, and as a gamer, this obviously causes issues. I use a Figma template to fill in any gaps for games that don't include a standard icon. I was able to get icons for the NVIDIA GeForce Now games to show up in Launchpad using Shortcuts. I've uploaded all my custom icons, including icons for non-games, to [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/2tpi7x0uhhr6rirs7vxl6/ABeWtX_jul17OFbtxge2sQE?rlkey=kjh6tmwiybku6su4u4r3ufewq&dl=0) if you're interested.



**ORGANIZATION**  
**Screen 1 / Row 2:** After the row of launchers, I stashed some "essentials". That'd be: Chess (give it up!), *Zen Pinball*, *Balatro*, and *World of Warcraft*.

**Screen 1 / Row 3:** The big, bad, AAA games. These are now a mix of native (*No Man's Sky*, *Death Stranding*, *Resident Evil 7*, *Alien Isolation*, and *BioShock*), virtual PC (*Cyberpunk*, *Red Dead*, and *GTA V*), and streamed titles (*Hitman*, *The Witcher*, and *Alan Wake II*). A little re-org will be necessary once I add in *Control* (released today).

**Screen 1 / Row 4:** After the AAA’s, I put some Mac gaming legends: *Myst* and *Riven*, along with their heir apparent: *The Witness*.

**Screen 1 / Row 5:** These are the indie games that changed my life and lit the fire within me. Again, *Fez*, *Undertale*, and *Kentucky Route Zero* were foundational games for me. Atmospheric games like *Proteus* and *Mountain* broadened what I understood the point of games to be.

**Screen 2 / Row 1-2:** More golden age of indie games. I stuck a couple of follow-ups by the developers in these rows too (looking at Lucas Pope's and Fullbright's games). Two of my favorites here are *Thirty Flights of Loving* and *Quadrilateral Cowboy*, both by the ingenious Blendo Games (Brendon Chung). Hoping their follow-up to *Quad Cowboy*, *Skin Deep*, will make its way to Mac eventually as well.

**Screen 2 / Row 3-5:** More essential indie titles, many of which are also from that golden age (thinking of *Beginners Guide* and *Her Story* especially as being landmarks). I see these rows mostly as being the fruit of the indie titles that came before.

**Screen 3:** Gets a little sloppy here. There's a mix of hard-to-bucket items, Apple Arcade titles, and a few spare launchers. There are a few odd balls towards the bottom like the *Triennale Game Collection.* This is a set of mini-games, many of which are developed by designers/studios in previous rows. My favorite of those mini-games is Cardboard Computer's (Kentucky Route Zero dev) *Neighbor*. It's something between *KRZ* and *Mountain*. *Kid A Mnesia Exhibit* is an interactive version of the album *Kid A Mnesia* by Radiohead and distributed by Epic Games. *About by PCalc* is a spin-off of the wonderful calculator app, PCalc. They stuck so many easter eggs into their about pane on macOS that they spun it out into its own game. Iconic. The PS2 Emulator I use to play *Shadow of the Colossus* exclusively.



**TLDR:** Never been a better time to game on the Mac.
