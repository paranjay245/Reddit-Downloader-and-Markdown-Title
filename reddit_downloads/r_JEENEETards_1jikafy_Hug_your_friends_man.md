## Post Text

Today morning at about 2:00 AM we got a call from her dad asking us to rush to the hospital. None of us were sleeping, infact we had left them at the hospital at about 11:30 PM the night before. When we reached there, I saw the most grueling sight i had ever seen. My bestfriend, she lay on the bed weak, pale, the heart monitor barely making a rise, I knew what was coming. She wanted one last goodbye. There were her parents, her brother, her relatives, our family and one more friend's family. I stood by her bedside as she spoke her last words. I hugged her one last time and then she was gone. Gone in such a small time. I didn't know what to do. I cried. I just cried in a long long time. My bestfriend, my sister, my buddy was gone. I'm now writing this with tears in my eyes. I don't know what to do. I am completely devastated.

We were friends since childhood. We lived in the same locality and had grown up playing together. I had seen her grow, from this shy, scared kid to this energetic confident teenager. She was always smart, always topped class. Won a bunch of olympiads. Scored 96 percent in 10th boards. And was preparing for JEE. Even though her scores plunged hard, she never really studied. She actually never studied hard and still scored better than me. She got 80 percentile in the Jan attempt and was planning to take a drop. I was gonna take a drop too. She was always fascinated by quantum physics and wanted to become a physicist. But it was pretty recent and I think it was cope, because she initially wanted to become a footballer. Had won a lot of football competitions, inter school, inter state and was also selected for nationals. But ofcourse sports has no career according to Indian parents and women's sports at that. So she started preparing for JEE. But she never stopped admiring and watching and playing it. We used to sit together to watch every Euros, FIFA, EUFA, LaLiga, etc. etc. She was a big fan of Mbappe, Haaland and Sam Kerr. She was also very interested in martial arts and mma and always wanted to learn mma. 

She was also interested in classical music. In fact she was the one who introduced me to classical music, the person in my username, Tchaikovsky was her favourite composer. I was always in awe of her interests, I mean how can one person be so interested and knowledgeable of so many different things. Separately, she also used to write poetry and read literature. And no wonder she never studied.

But she had one "secret". She was a lesbian. She had known since childhood and had told me back in 10th grade. It was actually funny since we were always together and our classmates used to ship us together but little did they know lmao. She had always been more masculine than the other girls, wearing shirts and basketball shorts, walking and talking like a boy and playing with us boys. She was the perfect kid, smart, confident, creative, charismatic and always ready to help. Infact we'd often joke that if she had been a guy, she would get all the girls. But she did confess to a girl back in 11th grade, and ofcourse she rejected her, calling her weird names and even pushing her back, that was the first time I saw her cry in a long long time. She always such a hopeless romantic and talked of women with such...beauty, it made me think of my own conceptions of women. She had always hoped to tell her parents once she was settled down and had a decent job and hot girlfriend, but ofcourse that day never arrived. She was just so.....cool. I never told her that but I always admired her so much. I loved her so much. As a sister. As my bestfriend. In fact I saw her as my brother. She was the reason I got into literature and started reading about so many things, war, philosophy, science fiction, women's movements. She changed a lot of my views on women and their struggle. We'd talk for hours on anything and everything.

I saw her health deteriorate in the beginning of 12th grade. Patli hogyi thi, haddiyan dikh rahi thi, uska weight 60 kg se seedhe 45. Bohot bimaar rehne lagi thi, classes miss karna, hospital jaana roz ka bann gaya tha. Mujhe pta tha isse kuchh to hua hai, maine usse puchha bhi, ek din jab hospital se vapas aayi thi, muh sookha hua, aankhe nam, par usne kuchh ni bataya. Shayad vo ye nhi chahti thi ki usse differently treat kare. JEE Mains ke 2 mahine pehle se usne classes attend karna hi band kardiya tha. Jaise taise mains diya usne. Bas aajse 2 hafte pehle usne mujhe bataya ki usse stage 4 glioblastoma hai, a type of malignant brain tumour. She wanted to live, she wanted to see the world and let the world know about herself. And she had a very bright future. I'm sure she would have thrived just anywhere. She was that good. And I wish she had atleast experienced love. 
This is one of the excerpts she wrote for her fictional muse :

`Yet I try, I try to capture the absolute splash of cold wind my heart feels when I look at her, then settles to an infinite warmth that only a collapsing star can parallel.`

But this is the reality. She is no more. God I miss her, I miss my bestfriend. I don't know how, what, what I can do now. I can't stop crying. I wish we spent more time together as we did when we were kids. Just playing football till eight at night without a care in the world.

I wanted to write this here, because I just don't know what to do now. She was the one I used to tell everything to.

I miss you gng. You're always in my heart brdr. RIP.

>>> so sorry to hear that I hope it gets better for you. He/she would be looking down from up there and would be happy to see you moving forward in life. Maybe you’re still grieving them but perhaps grief is the last and final act of love. The love you have for them meets them where your hands can’t. I hope the days forward bring you some peace and comfort 💗🍓

>>>>> Guilt is a spiral staircase you’d get nowhere with it, you have to think ki agar vo tumhe dekh pata toh would he want you to be sad and miserable or would he what you to cherish whatever you guys had. You lost your close friend and it’s hard Because you don’t expect someone who was well and good to just disappear the next day. I hope it gets easier for you. you might not get over it but you’ll learn to live with it. Don’t let the guilt eat away all the love you had for him.

>> (read from the emoji fir a direct answer the other part is me explaining something else which might be very wrong and is sourced on kurzgesagt videos and melody sheep) I am an atheist and also not an atheist the fact that there can exist a god but not too the universal system is stable without both how do you define a god , but our understanding is very limited but if you know about the kardashev scale let us consider a being ( a consciousness although we are still unclear what it is) so advanced that we can't understand it for instance a type 3 civilization is so advanced (ofc hypothetical yet) we are like amoebas compared to them so a type 5 civilization is basically a god and a rough estimate of a great entity, ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)A entity so enlightened so advanced such that it encompass and merges with the fabric of reality why would it be effected by the movement of some biomolecules? By which I mean the movement of biomolecules in one's body which leads to suffering or even physical suffering the movement of atoms

> (read from the emoji fir a direct answer the other part is me explaining something else which might be very wrong and is sourced on kurzgesagt videos and melody sheep) I am an atheist and also not an atheist the fact that there can exist a god but not too the universal system is stable without both how do you define a god , but our understanding is very limited but if you know about the kardashev scale let us consider a being ( a consciousness although we are still unclear what it is) so advanced that we can't understand it for instance a type 3 civilization is so advanced (ofc hypothetical yet) we are like amoebas compared to them so a type 5 civilization is basically a god and a rough estimate of a great entity, ![img](emote|t5_311ttu|52289)A entity so enlightened so advanced such that it encompass and merges with the fabric of reality why would it be effected by the movement of some biomolecules? By which I mean the movement of biomolecules in one's body which leads to suffering or even physical suffering the movement of atoms

Maybe you’re still grieving them but perhaps grief is the last and final act of love. The love you have for them meets them where your hands can’t.
