> We'll need more information on your issue. What's causing the problem? Lack of credits, too much battle damage, or do you not know where to get consumables?

>>> Sounds like you're going for trading, then. Spend your credits on a number of ships to guard your logistics vessels, and pirates won't willingly engage you. 3-4 destroyers and a similar number of frigates should be enough to prevent you from becoming a victim of casual piracy. It won't discourage larger fleets, though.

> Gonna have to play like a small fish in a pond early game like always be avoiding conflicts/pirate heavy systems, doing deliveries and slowly grab larger storage ships to take on more delivery quests, or alternatively you could go exploration route(grab more fuel ships) and do surveys , good way to find AI cores and rare colony enhancing artifacts, always look at your ships demods you should be hitting atleast 18 speed at all times with the burners on, there was a perk in the skill tree last update I played that increases your speed with that too. But I'm not a veteran player either I probably missed a lot , hopefully others can also share their advice.

> Drugs is your answer. I remember pirates being in constant need of drugs, so I’d buy from Tri-Tac and sell to the black market. There are ships that raise your inventory/fuel capacity. Make sure to buy a couple of those as well.

> In terms of money, it is generally not worth getting into any fights if you do not have bounties on it. This changes later when you have to defend your colony, or farm \[redacted\] for cores. But early on, its just not worth it, the cost of repairing and crew replacement is much higher than any salvage.
> 
> Second, early on, most fights are not worth it, especially if you dont safescum. Simply because most enemies will be stronger, so you just loose your ships without much gain.
> 
> So early on I would recommend to avoid fights as much as possible, only do bounties that are close by and where the enemies are really weaker. Otherwise better focus on trading, exploration missions, academy missions. Especially many of the academy missions are really good early on, and for story reasons you want to work with them anyway.

> In the beginning, its a good idea to focus on salvaging things in the core systems, when fights happen. You can also trade certain profitable goods like fuel or supplies. Also, you can trade with pirate stations (preferable black market), if your identification is set off. Just be carefull to not disable it, when patrols of the big factions are nearby, as they dont like it if you go silent suddenly. Buy cheap and sell it when theres a need. The next step is to either go exploring or to get a comission from one of the factions (you can also do both). For explorations you should have enough boni to reduce the costs for doing so, so that you only need 5 supplies each planet scan.

> Do the things people say here(drug selling, trading with places on shortage,  quests, exploration, etc) , buy cargo + fuel ships so you don't run out of fuel and supplies, and invest in the yellow skill tree(You can reset after) since it can help with costs.
> 
> And since you start weak, buying/salvaging combat ships or keeping your speed fast can help a lot.

> most of my money early on in most runs comes from exploration contracts, they are easy to do unless it's a survey job, and with only a dram, and a shepherd you can go very far out into the outer edges of the sector. The only real threat is other small pirate fleets, but with a burn speed of 20 you can out run just about anything threating to you. Contract work is the most reliable way for early game money from what I can tell and most of it is pretty easy.

> I don't know if it has been mentioned before. But you can also to take commission from the factions. This will give you a steady income increasing as your level rises. Capping at $95,000 per month.
> 
> As others mentioned drug smuggling is a quick way to get a lot of money. You can hover over the item in the market and press F1 to see the cheapest places to buy and best places to sell. Usually best to buy from pirates like Kanta's Den and sell to the highest bidder.(Again check the market).
> 
> Look for system bounties in the early game. factions will pay between $1,000 and $1,500 per enemy ship destroyed. This will stack with your faction commission and other factions bounties for the same system.
> 
> My general rule of thumb is to buy supplies in bulk from Chicomoztoc and fuel from Nachieketa. This will save you a lot in the long run. This will also mean most of your activities are based around that area and a Hedgemony commission is a must. The is a similar production planet for fuel and supplies but I can't recall the name. Also buy crew from Luddic Path or pirates for the most part.

> There are a few other things but they are minor and easy enough to find on YouTube or the wiki.
